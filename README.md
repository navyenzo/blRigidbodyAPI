# blRigidBodyApi

## What is it?

[blRigidBodyApi](https://github.com/navyenzo/blRigidbodyAPI.git) is for now a very minimal collection of algorithms and data structures that can work as a basis for more advanced physics libraries.

It a header only library where I put all the algorithms I've developed and used over the years in physics simulations.

It is going to grow and eventually become a [Bond Graph](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-141-modeling-and-simulation-of-dynamic-systems-fall-2006/index.htm) library geared towards the engineering/simulation of multiphysics systems

## How do I use it?

It is a header only library, all you have to do is include its header `#include <blRigidBodyAPI.hpp>` and everything is defined within the `namespace blRigidBodyAPI`

## Dependencies
